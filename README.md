# WarehouseInventoryManagementSystem

A modular Java 17 application for managing warehouse inventory, orders and shipping in a real-world logistics context. The system demonstrates industry-grade design through the application of core Gang of Four patterns, making it easy to extend, test and maintain.

## üèÜ Purpose

- **Centralize configuration** (thresholds, API URLs, credentials) in a single, thread-safe service.  
- **Manage products** and quickly clone ‚Äútemplates‚Äù without rebuilding every field.  
- **Build complex orders** step-by-step, with optional fields (customer, items, delivery date, instructions).  
- **Select shipping services** dynamically (ground, air, express) without coupling business logic to concrete classes.  
- **Expose a clean API** fa√ßade that hides the complexity of inventory reservation, order persistence and shipping.  
- **Cache stock queries** to reduce backend load and improve performance.  
- **Support multiple replenishment policies** (average usage, peak demand) that can be swapped at runtime.  
- **Orchestrate order processing** via a chain of independent handlers (validation, logging, notification).
